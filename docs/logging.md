# Logging

The app logs errors etc. to file and optionally can send an email whenever a message is logged. Different logging levels can be set for both by means of the respective environment variables. The available levels are those defined in the `logging` module, i.e. `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `DEBUG` and `NOTSET`.

The log files are automatically rolled over when their size reaches the value specified by the environment variable  `LOGGING_FILE_MAX_BYTES`. The number of backed up copies kept is set by the environment variable `LOGGING_FILE_BACKUP_COUNT`. If `LOGGING_FILE_MAX_BYTES` or `LOGGING_FILE_BACKUP_COUNT` is 0, the log file is never rolled over. See the documentation for `logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler` for more details.

The logging handler are attached to the app. So in order to access them, you have to use code like the following.

```python
from flask import current_app

current_app.logger.error('This is an error.')
current_app.logger.warning('This is a warning.')
```
